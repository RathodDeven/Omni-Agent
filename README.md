# DeFAI Omni-Agent

**Short Description**  
DeFAI Omni-Agent is a multi-chain AI-driven trading agent that issues its own token and pursues on-chain profit across multiple L2s (Base, Arbitrum, Warden). By staking or buying into the token, users can potentially earn rewards proportional to the AI agent’s profits. The agent uses secure private key storage (Lit Protocol or Nillion) for signing transactions, AgentKit for streamlined onchain operations, and Warden Protocol for programmable automation of DeFi trades based on specific conditions. The application is deployed and orchestrated through Autonome, ensuring a trust-minimized, production-ready AI agent infrastructure.

## Project Highlights

- **AI Trading Agent**  
  Our agent uses large language model reasoning (optionally via AgentKit or a custom integration) to analyze market data fetched from The Graph or other oracle endpoints. It signs transactions securely and executes them on Base, Arbitrum, or Warden.
  
- **Multi-Chain & Bridge Capabilities**  
  The agent can operate across different L2s, bridging assets if profitable arbitrage or yield opportunities arise.

- **Token Issuance**  
  Investors can acquire the $DEFAI coin. The agent's profits, if any, flow back into the project, rewarding token holders with staking rewards or buybacks.

- **Secure Key Management**  
  By using **Lit Protocol** or **Nillion**, we ensure the agent’s private keys for on-chain execution remain secure and never leak to the environment.

- **On-Chain Automation**  
  Through **Warden Protocol**, we can specify conditions and rules (like price triggers, position rebalances, risk checks) that automatically execute on chain once conditions are met.

- **Hosted via Autonome**  
  The entire AI agent logic is deployed on **Autonome**, so it can run 24/7 with robust verifiability and minimal overhead.
